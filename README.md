# Official Code of DeFlip Games

DeFlip is a DeFi-powered Telegram bot designed to bring exciting, luck-based games to the Telegram platform. Players can participate in various games to win DeFlip tokens, with the added twist that 50% of losing bets are burned, making the native DeFlip token deflationary over time.

This mechanism not only creates thrilling gameplay but also supports the long-term sustainability and value appreciation of the DeFlip token.

# Games

DeFlip currently offers three engaging games, each designed to cater to different player preferences:

Coin FlipTest your luck by betting on heads or tails. Win the bet, and you receive 1.75x your wager; lose, and 50% of your bet is burned, contributing to the deflationary mechanics of the DeFlip token.

Dice RollPlayers roll a virtual die and bet on their number outcome. Win the bet, and you receive 4.5x your wager. Depending on the level of risk and bet type, you could win big or lose your wager.

High-LowPredict whether the next number will be higher or lower. Win the bet, and you receive 2x your wager. Lose, and 50% of your bet is burned.

# Technical Notes
